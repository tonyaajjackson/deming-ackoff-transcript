# Licensing
All rights remain with the Ackoff Center, the distributor of the original PDF. Out of appreciation of the content and desire to share it with more people, I have transcribed the scanned PDF into text, but I make no claims on the rights to this text. The Ackoff Centre distributes the original PDF freely online, so I assume they would be okay with similar distribution of the text version.

If you are a representative of the Ackoff Centre and would like to contact me, please send me an email to the address listed in my GitHub profile.
